### Project Overview

 In this student managemnet system we basically had to apply all our knowledge of python data strcutures, operators ,etc to print a given output which was to print the name of the student who scored maximum marks in mathematics.


### Learnings from the project

 1. How to merge list.
2.Operations on list.
3.Operations in a dictionary




### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Firstly i created two different lists contaning different students name than i merged them into a single list than i realized one student's name was missing so i added his name.Than a student's name was to be deleted i did that. 
After that i created a dictionary to store student's marks in various subjects and found their percentages.
After that i created a dictionary which had all the student's marks in mathematics. I found the candidate with highest score and printed his name as it would be on a certificate.
